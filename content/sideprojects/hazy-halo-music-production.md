## Humdrum

We composed Humdrum in a ballad style and it takes the listener on an allegorical journey through the eyes of "Pluto". The poem juxtaposes two creatures of habit, the dog and the man and ponders the dichotomy between the two. The beautiful album art, drawn by Aiswarya perfectly encapsulates this condition. My sister, Swetha sang the song and we had some help from her friends for programming and mixing.

## Moonshine in the dark

Moonshine in the dark began as a simple song I made up while strumming the F and C chords on the ukulele. It explores the plight of lovers who have to make difficult choices. The wonderful album art painted by my friend, Indu adeptly captures the theme of the music. Some magic from my talented guitarist friend, Sidharth and my sister transformed it into a heartwarming song. Although, I am not as good at singing as my sister.

## Future plans

I have more songs/poems in the pipeline but my sister and I have both moved to different places in the world. Hopefully, we find the time to make more music. It is after all an extremely satisfying creative work.
