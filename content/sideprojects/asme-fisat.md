### Background

India has a lot of engineering colleges and engineering graduates. The job opportunities are not proportional to the number of people graduating from the various engineering streams each year. The ones who do secure jobs within the country have to settle for terrible working conditions, sub-par pay, and fairly unimaginative job roles. Obviously there are exceptions. Most engineering colleges manufacture graduates as feedstock for MNCs mostly in the IT sector either as software professionals or sales representatives. The way engineering is taught in most institutions is at best terrible. After all, graduate manufacturing is a far more lucrative industry than engineering education. Due to a lack of ambition and an understanding of the world, young Sriram found himself in a rigged system, traversing a path doomed from the start. 

### Questions

* Is the number of opportunities proportional to the number of engineers? 
* Do we get sufficient exposure? (industry, research, etc.)
* For an institution with so many future engineers does enough engineering happen?
* Is the way we learn effective? Does passion for engineering and science get passed on to the students?
* Do we apply what we learn? (productivity, planning, sustainability etc.)
* Do we use resources like books, journals etc.?
* Are we guaranteed a career? Do we have a future?

I posed the above questions in one of the best engineering universities in Kerala, India, TKM when I was invited to talk about the opportunities for students in the **American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).** 

### What did I do?

ASME offers plenty of local and global opportunities for students to get involved in engineering and research. Something most engineering colleges fail to do. In my final year of undergrad (2018), I was the **Chairman of the ASME Student Chapter** at my institute**,** the year before that I presented my project at the International Mechanical Engineering Congress & Exposition (IMECE 2017) in Tampa, Florida. I have talked in multiple engineering institutes across Kerala about the benefits of taking part in ASME activities. But what I am most proud of is what we did in my undergrad institute.

We actively encouraged participation in different ASME competitions such as Human Powered Vehicle Challenge, Student Design Competition, Innovative Additive Manufacturing 3D Challenge, etc. by starting esoteric clubs for each. This actively paved the way for many students to participate in these exciting engineering activities, and even fly to the US. We hosted various events at our institute as well including ASME's regional EFx event in 2018. Our chapter even won a cash prize for the best student section in less than three years in 2016. At the end of my term as chairman, I organized a seminar on Gas Turbines via ASME Gas Turbines India chapter wherein 7 industry experts from GE, Rolls Royce, Siemens etc. held sessions on various aspects of Gas turbines and aerospace engineering. These are intriguing mechanical engineering companies and our students got the exposure that my institute couldn't provide. 

**That's it, couple of students fought for exposure and a venue to take part in engineering beyond the classroom notes and we won.**
