Since the beginning, astronomy has been about looking out of the planet into the unknown and trying to understand humanity’s place in the vast universe. Throughout the years, from our vantage point in the cosmos, the oldest science has uncovered several facts that serve as constant reminders to its pursuers about the uniqueness of our planet. A cozy corner away from violent explosions, colliding rocks, and hot winds, from where humanity has wondered about its place in the universe - for generations. After peering deep and far into the universe, studying planets across our Galaxy, and grappling with technology and physical limitations, we can confidently say that there is **no Planet B**. The scientific community sees the fragility of life as it dangles by a narrow thread, protected by a thin sheath of air that is continuously being exploited. It is glaringly evident that human beings have accelerated and are accelerating global warming by recklessly emitting greenhouse gases, even to this day when alternatives exist.

> “There is an anesthetic of familiarity, a sedative of ordinariness which dulls the senses and hides the wonder of existence. …"
<cite> Richard Dawkins </cite>

As we traverse through life bombarded with the mundane, we seldom realize when this anesthesia kicks in. There are simply too many battles for us to fight and we rarely win. Whereas this anesthesia is like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, immediately offering relief. 

*Our fight for the planet does not have to be fought with guns, the call for reform does not have to be fraught with anger, the protest against harmful practices does not always have to be out on the streets. This can begin in our everyday lives by abolishing everyday practices **fueled by lies**.*

 It is up to us to reflect on unsustainable practices that have seeped into our lives. The solution is simple; it starts with switching off lights when not required, to recycling, composting, and planting trees. **Just like that our everyday life becomes the protest, a proof of what is possible.**  

## Green SAAO's promises

Green SAAO was born out of the need for addressing the threat of climate change and Astronomy’s role in the fight for the planet. For this, we must first evaluate and adopt practices to curb SAAO’s impact on the environment. As SAAO continues to look out into the open skies, Green SAAO adds the promise of looking inward as well. Inward as a community, as a species, and as a planet. This journey is to ensure that our impact on this system that grounds us in our pursuit of knowledge is as minimal as possible. This is not a one-stop destination but an ongoing commitment in tandem with our scientific pursuits and it requires dedication from all the staff. 

The second promise is tied with SAAO’s outreach activities. While continuing to serve as the eyes of the planet, it is also our responsibility to join other voices for the planet in effectively communicating the dangers of climate change and in pushing for global structural reforms, especially from the perspective of astronomy. 

## What are we doing?

- We are working with site management to install sustainable waste management practices within the organization. This includes recycling, composting, e-waste management, and running internal campaigns for spreading awareness.
- We are currently running internal campaigns for optimal resource utilization. 
- We are working with the outreach team to incorporate climate change communication as part of astronomy outreach.
- We are planning to draft proposals for fynbos restoration and solar power generation in our Cape Town site.
- We are working towards estimating and monitoring SAAO's carbon footprint.
