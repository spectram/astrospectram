I am currently interested in studying gas kinematics and galaxy dynamics in various gravitational potential wells using multi-wavelength spectroscopy and simulations. **I am looking for Ph.D. opportunities (starting in 2023) in related research areas.** To check out my publications list and to download my CV [click here]({{< ref "/publications_cv" >}}).

I am a Masterâ€™s candidate at the [Department of Astronomy, University of Cape Town (UCT)](http://www.ast.uct.ac.za/), based at the [South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO)](https://www.saao.ac.za/), funded through the SALT-SAAO Prize MSc Fellowship 2021, and supervised by Dr. Moses Mogotsi and Prof. Matthew A. Bershady. My dissertation work focuses on **the gas kinematics of interacting galaxies in groups**. For this, I am analaysing the resolved properties of the neutral gas in two groups part of the Choirs sample, with varying levels of tidal interactions, using MeerKAT (HI 21 cm). I will also be using data from SALT to charecterize the ionized gas phase.

Prior to this, I worked with [Prof. Anand Narayanan](https://www.iist.ac.in/ess/anand) at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST, Kerala, India) to study the **extended gaseous environment around galaxies using QSO absorption line spectroscopy** with archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck Observatory ([Pradeep, Sankar, et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..250P/abstract), [Sankar et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.4864S/abstract), [Sameer et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5796S/abstract)). To read more about my research [click here]({{< ref "/research" >}}).

Aside from astrophysical research, I enjoy a range of activities like: reading philosophical novels; writing poetry; creating music; binging on anime, sci-fi shows, documentaries, etc.; outdoor activities such as gardening, hiking, stargazing, etc.; exploring open-source codes and cool software technologies. I also spend some time thinking about and working on climate action through personal lifestyle choices and pushing for systemic changes in my immediate environment. To read about some of my side-projects [click here]({{< ref "/sideprojects" >}}).

I have filled this website with poems that I have written over the years and images from my gallery. I have also added some of the projects that I was able to bequeath life to through dedication and hard work. In other words, I am committing a small part of myself to a Github repository. If you want to Astro-know-me! [click here]({{< ref "/thoughts" >}}).

> Thoughts think me, thought I   
But I am but a thought  
A hundred I exist  
In a hundred minds, I fit  
Zillion impressions persist  
The hundred I coexist  
Sometimes thoughts desist  
But I never resist  
For a hundred I exist  
None of which is me

I started with a Stackbit v1 theme but heavily modified it for my purpose (stackbit v2 platform is looking great, I highly recommend it).
