I am an ASTRO3D PhD student at the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR), University of Western Australia (UWA) working with Prof. Barbara Catinella and Prof. Chris Power. I hold an MSc. degree from the [Department of Astronomy, University of Cape Town (UCT)](https://science.uct.ac.za/department-astronomy), where I was the recipient of the [SALT-SAAO Prize MSc Scholarship](https://www.saao.ac.za/salt-saao-prize-scholarship/) in 2021 conferred by the [South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO)](https://www.saao.ac.za/). I study the link between galaxy disks and multiphase gas across environments ranging from the dense Inter-Stellar Medium to the diffuse cluster outskirts using radio interferometry (HI emission), Integral field spectroscopy, UV/Optical QSO absorption line spectroscopy, and hydrodynamic simulations.

Briefly, disk galaxies such as the Milky Way are embedded in spherical gaseous mediums and they require a constant supply of gas to sustain forming stars. The surrounding medium comprises mostly hot but also cold gas. The existence of cold clouds in the hot medium has raised many intriguing questions. These clouds could either be gas falling into the stellar disk or gas removed at earlier times and their origin can be investigated by studying the chemical signatures, kinematics, environment, etc. Subsequently, numerous theories have been postulated for the existence of these clouds. However, due to observational, theoretical, and computational challenges, we do not yet fully understand **gas flows in and around galaxies**. To answer these and deeper questions therein, we must compare multi-wavelength, multi-epoch, and multi-technique observations with various theoretical models and simulations of multi-phase gas in and around diverse sets of galaxies. Over the past couple of years, I have delved into multiple wavelengths, observational techniques, as well as idealized hydrodynamic simulations to study the connection between galaxies and multi-phase gas across various environments.

### Brief research trajectory

I visited Tel Aviv to collaborate with [Dr. Jonathan Stern](https://www.sternjon.sites.tau.ac.il/) on a **new framework for the formation of warps and extraplanar gas**. Here, I employed analytic calculations, idealized hydrodynamic simulations, and comparisons with observations to study **HI warps produced by misaligned, hot, and rotating CGM inflows**. The manuscript from this work is in preperation.

My MSc. dissertation supervised by Dr. Moses Mogotsi and Prof. Matthew A. Bershady, is titled "**Kinematics of neutral hydrogen in interacting galaxies in two groups from the MeerChoirs survey**". For this, I reduced interferometric data and analyzed the kinematics of the neutral hydrogen emission in two low-mass, late-type dominated groups featuring varying levels of interactions. Luckily, I got to work with what is **currently the most sensitive radio telescope for observing neutral hydrogen in the local universe**, [**MeerKAT**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeerKAT), an [**SKA-mid**](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/telescopes/ska-mid) precursor. The manuscripts from this work are currently in preparation.

I am currently leading **MeerRings, a MeerKAT campaign**, to carry out the first resolved, deep, and systematic census of the neutral hydrogen and L-band continuum in a sample of eight Collisional Ring Galaxies (CRGs). It will also be the first systematic investigation of anomalous gas resulting from a well-known class of interactions. This campaign is in its nascency.

In my work with [Prof. Anand Narayanan](https://www.iist.ac.in/ess/anand) at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST, Kerala, India), I employed **UV/optical QSO absorption line spectroscopy** with archival data from the **Hubble Space Telescope** and **Keck Observatory** to study the small-scale physical and chemical properties of multi-phase gas in the extended environments around galaxies. This collaboration yielded three journal articles amidst the COVID-19 pandemic ([Pradeep, Sankar, et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..250P/abstract), [Sankar et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.4864S/abstract), [Sameer et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5796S/abstract)).

### Brief technical experience

Thanks to my schooling, I was introduced to programming when I was fifteen years old. Object-oriented programming, `C++`, and `SQL` were part of my high school curriculum and I had some wonderful teachers who taught me several algorithms on a blackboard. I had a course on `C` in my engineering undergrad and I picked up `IDL/GDL`, `Python`, and some basic `bash` during my time at IIST. At SAAO and since, I further advanced my `Python` programming skills through writing code in a high-performance computation context. I have employed numerous features such as virtual environments, array manipulations, list/dictionary comprehension, classes, parallel processing, packaging, and even a bit of JIT. My experience utilizing [ilifu](https://www.ilifu.ac.za/), to reduce and analyze high-volume interferometric data allowed me to pick up containerization, optimal resource utilization, git version control, etc. At SAAO, as part of the analysis pipeline that I developed, I wrote a program to perform physically motivated component identification and separation on 3D spectral cubes. I also created a visualization pipeline that produced several informational plots that supplemented my analysis. At TAU, I learned how to run numerical simulations using `Gizmo` on [AWS-EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html). I further learned to analyze and visualize multidimensional simulated datasets and to generate mock 3D HI cubes from 6D simulated snapshots. Using the technical skills and open-science best practices that I have picked up over the years, I have developed efficient workflows that bolster my productivity. I am extremely grateful for the amazing packages developed by the scientific and open-source community that have allowed me to develop these powerful workflows for my research. I am committed to the open-source principles and am currently contributing to multiple astronomy projects such as `baygaud-PI`, and `yt_astro_analysis`. In the near future, I hope to extend some of my current workflows into packages for the community.   -->

### Fortunately, I am not just my work

Aside from astrophysical research, I enjoy a range of activities such as: reading philosophical novels; writing poetry; creating music; binging on - anime, sci-fi shows, and documentaries; outdoor activities such as gardening, hiking, and stargazing; and exploring open-source codes and cool software technologies. I also spend some time thinking about and working on climate action through personal lifestyle choices and pushing for systemic changes in my immediate environment.

I have filled this website with some of the poems that I have written over the years and some images from my gallery. I have also added some of the projects that I was able to bequeath life to through dedication and hard work. In other words, I am committing a small part of myself to a GitHub repository.

> Thoughts think me, thought I   
But, I am but a thought  
A hundred I exist  
In a hundred minds, I fit  
Zillion impressions persist  
The hundred I coexist  
Sometimes thoughts desist  
But I never resist  
For a hundred I exist  
None of which is me    
Yet, all of which is me

I started with a Stackbit v1 theme but heavily modified it for my purpose (stackbit v2 platform is looking great, I highly recommend it).
