I am currently interested in studying gas kinematics and galaxy dynamics in various gravitational potential wells using spatially resolved multi-wavelength spectroscopy and simulations. **I am looking for Ph.D. opportunities (starting in 2023) in closely related research areas.** To check out my publications list and to download my CV [click here]({{< ref "/publications_cv" >}}).

I am a Masterâ€™s candidate at the [Department of Astronomy, University of Cape Town (UCT)](http://www.ast.uct.ac.za/), based at the [South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO)](https://www.saao.ac.za/), funded through the SALT-SAAO Prize MSc Fellowship 2021, and supervised by Dr. Moses Mogotsi and Prof. Matthew Bershady. My thesis is on understanding **the confluence of galaxy evolution and group evolution traced by the multiphase baryon cycle in groups**. For this, I am studying two groups part of the Choirs sample, with varying levels of tidal interactions, using MeerKAT (HI 21 cm) and SALT. 

Prior to this, I worked with [Prof. Anand Narayanan](https://www.iist.ac.in/ess/anand) at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST, Kerala, India) to study the **extended gaseous environment around galaxies using QSO absorption line spectroscopy** with archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck Observatory ([Pradeep, Sankar, et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..250P/abstract), [Sankar et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.4864S/abstract), [Sameer et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5796S/abstract)). To read more about my research [click here]({{< ref "/research" >}}).

Aside from astrophysical research, I enjoy reading philosophical novels, writing poetry, creating music, binging on anime, sci-fi shows, documentaries, etc., outdoor activities such as gardening, hiking, stargazing, etc., and exploring open-source codes and other cool technologies. I also spend some time thinking about and working on climate action through personal lifestyle choices and pushing for systemic changes in my immediate environment. To read about some of my side-projects [click here]({{< ref "/sideprojects" >}}).

I have filled this website with poems that I have written over the years and images from my gallery. I have also added some of the projects that I was able to bequeath life to through dedication and hard work. In other words, I am committing a small part of myself to a Github repository.

> Thoughts think me, thought I   
But I am but a thought  
A hundred I exist  
In a hundred minds, I fit  
Zillion impressions persist  
The hundred I coexist  
Sometimes thoughts desist  
But I never resist  
For a hundred I exist  
None of which is me

I started with a Stackbit v1 theme but heavily modified it for my purpose (stackbit v2 platform is looking great, I highly recommend it).
