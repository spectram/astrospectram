I am currently interested in studying the gas kinematics and galaxy dynamics in various gravitational potential wells using spatially resolved multi-wavelength spectroscopy and simulations. I am now looking for PhD opportunities (starting in 2023) in closely related research areas.

I am a Masterâ€™s candidate at the [Department of Astronomy, University of Cape Town (UCT)](http://www.ast.uct.ac.za/) based at and funded by the [South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO)](https://www.saao.ac.za/) through the SALT-SAAO Prize MSc Fellowship 2021 and supervised by Dr. Moses Mogotsi and Prof. Matthew Bershady. My thesis is on understanding the confluence of galaxy evolution and group evolution by studying the multiphase baryon cycle in two groups with varying levels of tidal interactions, using MeerKAT (HI 21 cm) and SALT . 

Prior to this, I worked with [Prof. Anand Narayanan](https://www.iist.ac.in/ess/anand) at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST, Kerala, India) to study the extended gaseous environment around galaxies using QSO absorption line spectroscopy with archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck Observatory ([Pradeep, Sankar, et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..250P/abstract), [Sankar et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.4864S/abstract), [Sameer et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5796S/abstract)).

My diverse background and unorthodox trajectory has gifted me with an eclectic set of skills and interests that range from poetry to programming. Aside from astrophysical research, I enjoy reading philosophical novels, binging on anime and sci-fi shows, outdoor activities such as gardening and hiking, volunteering for causes, exploring open-source codes and cool new technologies, etc. I spend a lot of time thinking about and working on climate action through personal lifestyle choices and pushing for systemic changes in my immediate environment.

I started with a Stackbit v1 theme but heavily modified it for my purpose (stackbit v2 platform is looking really good, I highly recommend it). Thank You for visiting! Hope you enjoy your stay!
