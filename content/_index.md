Here i will write about my broad research intersts.

I am a Master’s student at the [Department of Astronomy, University of Cape Town (UCT)](http://www.ast.uct.ac.za/) based at and funded by the [South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO)](https://www.saao.ac.za/) through the SALT-SAAO Prize MSc Fellowship 2021. My supervisors are Dr. Moses Mogotsi and Prof. Matthew Bershady. For my thesis on the synergy between galaxy and group evolution traced by the baryon cycle, I make use of data from MeerKAT and SALT to study multiphase gas in and around galaxies in two low-z groups. 

Prior to this, I worked with Prof. Anand Narayanan at the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST, Kerala, India) to study the extended gaseous environment of galaxies using QSO absorption line spectroscopy using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck Observatory ([Pradeep, Sankar, et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..250P/abstract), [Sankar et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.4864S/abstract), [Sameer et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5796S/abstract)).

My diverse background and unorthodox trajectory has gifted me with an eclectic set of skills and interests that range from poetry to programming. Aside from astronomy research, I enjoy reading philosophical novels, binging on anime and sci-fi shows', outdoor activities such as gardening and hiking, volunteering for causes and activities, exploring open-source codes and latest technologies, etc. I spend a lot of time thinking about and working on climate action through personal lifestyle choices and pushing for systemic changes in my immediate environment. 

*Hi there! Welcome to my little creative repository on the internet. That’s right! you are looking at a JAMSTACK website hosted on a github repo and deployed through Netlify. I had some help from Stackbit during development. The next item on the agenda is to incorporate a headless CMS into the mix (I am thinking NetlifyCMS). Thank You for visiting! Hope you enjoy your stay!*
