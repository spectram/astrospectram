Leaves fluttering in the wind   
Ephemeral butterflies living their dreams   
Wings flailing yet tethered to the ground   
Rising ever so slightly, distant from soil to sky   

On windless days,    
Life's breath held, in silence   
In hiatuses from the struggle     
Mustering strength for the final fight    

Indifferent to the plight    
It is finally time to take flight    
Untethered, leaves journey to the ground    
Wondering, if they could ever have been butterflies    

Like sandcastles crumbled by waves    
Delusions of grandeur and fate    
With each falling leaf carried by the wind    
Dreams and possibilities fade into echoes    
Wondering, if they could ever have been real.
