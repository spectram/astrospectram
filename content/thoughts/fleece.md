The world's happiest man  
The world's saddest of men  
Depression, his only friend   
and then there was the li’l girl who cried   
He offered her his soul   
A piece of the torn scroll   
The girl smiled through her tears   
His dose of ephemeral happiness   

From then on every time she cried,   
he tore away piece by piece   
from what was left of his beautiful tattered fleece.   
As the wind grew cold,   
he smiled through broken teeth   
at the girl who shivered beneath the ragged fleece.   
He feared sinking in the debauchery   
yet her smile was all he had   
and he was all she had   

The day came when he had nothing left to give   
The day when his breath was no longer in the wind   
The li’l girl wept her heart out and hasn't stopped since   
The fleece, still ragged and the nights, grow colder still   

Should he have given her the first piece?   
His happiness became her sadness.    
And her happiness, fleeting like his breath.
