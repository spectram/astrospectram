Caged by strange norms of congeniality   
oppression masquerading as courtesy   
forced to revere the same pompous men   
who plunder our lives, our world, our aspiration    
under the guise of grandiosity and salvation     

highfalutin creatures out of touch with reality     
demanding the world for propriety    
defined by the high society    
feeding off of our lives for their vanity    
blinding us with accusations of insanity    

firehosing lies with no heed to our cries    
burning our planet before our eyes    
their self-serving ways fuelling collective demise    
gobbledygook of looking to the skies    
don’t be fooled, it’s yet another disguise
