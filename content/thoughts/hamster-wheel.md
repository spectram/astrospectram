The world seems so small   
You try standing tall    
Keep running, the cheese you must eat    
Forget your aching feet    
You are a Hamster in a wheel     
Nobody cares what you feel

Cursed to run barefoot    
Focused on what lay above    
Taunting you to reach out     
Hiding the truth, you will never be    
Your real goal should be to be free   

The moment you realize this    
The sound of the lash making you run faster     
Don't you dare disobey the master     
You are just a hamster in a wheel     
Going round and round      
Chasing a false destiny     

You question your reality    
But there's no stopping the wheel    
Keep running till the clock runs out      
Run till your shadow fades     
The treat keeps slipping away     
So close! maybe next time     
The illusion of a life     
keeps you from the knife     

You are just a hamster in a system of wheels    
See the world above, see wheels just like yours     
All hamsters stuck like you     
There's the lash     
Don't slow down, keep running      
Keep the wheel spinning      
Amuse your master      
Don't stop Mr. Hamster
