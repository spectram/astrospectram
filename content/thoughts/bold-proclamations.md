Life has progressed a lot    
But through a rather unconventional path    
So it is difficult to say   
If I've moved at all   

In this stillness,    
as I wander aimlessly,    
gathering all that I can to hold myself together,    
all that I planted, grow at their own pace    

Bold proclamations,     
that were once buried deep     
some forgotten, others rotten     
some full-grown trees, others fledgling saplings      

Sprouted above ground, rooted far beneath      
the rotten and the forgotten nourish     
the trees protect and cherish      
together symbiotically they all flourish     

With more proclamations to be sown     
I cannot help but adore my forest     
Thoughts that came to life    
and life that hides in thoughts     

Surreal. Yet, I've hardly budged.
