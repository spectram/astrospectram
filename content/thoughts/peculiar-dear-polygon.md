Peculiar dear polygon   
Carry on scrollin' on   
How absurd this   
Hedonistic kiss   
Binary voodoo what you do   
Even this thought fed to you   
Parallel lines all around   
Congruent shapes abound   

Peculiar dear polygon   
Find your grid, your echelon   
Choose what to feel   
I can see you reel   
The buttons and levers   
Drilled into your femurs   
Resist all you want   
It'll persist nonchalant   

Peculiar dear friend   
Look where we find ourselves in   
In a system of rhymes   
In a sea of patterns   
How absurd this   
Hedonistic kiss   
Peculiar dear polygon    
Carry on scrollin' on   

Peculiar dear polygon   
It has only just begun   
Watch duality rein   
As you succumb to the pain   
In multiple grids, you fit   
Even your rebellious quilt   
Predictable evolution   
Foredoomed revolution
