## Gas and the Baryon Cycle

Gas is a major part of galaxies, occupying a range of regions from the space between stars [(Interstellar Medium; ISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium)) to the outskirts ([Circumgalactic Medium; CGM](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-astro-091916-055240)). In groups, they occupy the Intra-Group Medium (IGrM) and in clusters, the [Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracluster_medium). Outside these environments, they permeate the filamentary structures of the cosmic web ([Intergalactic Medium; IGM](https://www.britannica.com/science/intergalactic-medium)). These might seem like fancy names for the same thing, but the physical properties and origin of gas in these regions are diverse. One can easily appreciate that gas near galaxies is more metal-enriched than gas in the IGM. Gas is essential for sustaining star formation and there are various ways in which galaxies obtain this fuel (accretion, mergers, interactions, etc.). The stars in the galaxies then leave their signatures in the gas during their lifetime. 

The baryon cycle is a complex phenomenon that encapsulates all the ways in which gas gets perpetually processed in overdensities. From the infall of gas into galactic potentials, collapse into and processing by stars, outflow due to stellar and/or AGN feedback, and even "mixing" due to cooling. It can be thought of as the flow of multiphase gas within and between three broad settings: the ISM, the CGM, and the extended environment. These are important laboratories for studying a range of physical processes important for galaxy evolution and structure formation. However, gas exists in multiple phases ranging from cold dense molecular gas to hot diffuse ionized plasma, adding additional layers of complexity. We, therefore, employ clever techniques and multi-wavelength observations to study the different phases of gas occupying the various mediums. 

**TLDR:** Gas in the universe = Multiple phases (temperature, density, volume, etc.); Multiple regions (ISM, CGM, IGrM, ICM, IGM);

**Workaround:** Multiple Wavelengths & Techniques => CO in sub-mm for molecular gas; HI 21cm in radio for neutral gas; Emission lines like Halpha, [OIII], [NII], etc. in Optical/UV for cold and warm gas; X-ray, radio continuum, tSZ effect in the microwave, FRBs, etc. for high energy processes (hot gas*). Then there is absorption line spectroscopy of background sources (QSOs, GRBs, galaxies, lensed galaxies, etc.). Statistical sampling, high-resolution simulations, and multi-wavelength observations are employed to study the complex density profile, phase structure, and kinematics of gas in various environments. 


## Gas kinematics and galaxy dynamics in groups

Multi-phase studies of the baryon cycle in groups at different stages of assembly combined with the multi-wavelength characterization of galaxies in the groups will inform us of the gas kinematics, group dynamics, galaxy properties, and subsequently the evolution of both groups and galaxies. While some works find increased star formation suppression events in groups, several others find enhanced star formation due to gas supply from satellite galaxies, mergers, and accretion from the extended environment. This dichotomy of gas-rich and gas-poor groups has been linked to the stage in group evolution with the former being in early and the latter in late stages of assembly. Even though it is well known that galaxies shape and are shaped by their environments, the relative contribution of environmental and internal galactic processes remains poorly understood. 

As part of my Master's thesis, we study the baryon cycle in two nearby low-mass, gas-rich, late-type dominated, and relatively isolated groups where the biggest members show varying levels of tidal interaction. This work is part of the **MeerChoirs** collaboration led by my supervisor, Moses. The high spatial & spectral resolution, sensitivity, and wide field-of-view of **MeerKAT** enable us to detect HI down to N{HI} $\sim 3 \times 10^{19} \text{cm}^{-2}$ and to probe a major extent of the group. We explore previously known and unknown dwarf members, tidal interactions, inflows/outflows, etc. to accurately characterize the group environments and to study the kinematics of the neutral gas in the group. Resolved studies of such unique laboratories that encapsulate several key processes of the baryon cycle spanning the ISM, CGM, and IGrM are crucial for constraining galaxy evolution models. 

We also plan to utilize optical spectra from RSS-SALT to study the chemical properties of the galaxies and the kinematic properties of the ionized phase traced by Hɑ. A small part of the sample was observed in 2021 Semester II as part of SALTChoirs (PI: Sankar). We intend to follow this up with another proposal for 2022 Semester II. 


#### Recent developments in Radio Astronomy

Radio astronomy offers a crucial view of several aspects of the universe, from fast radio bursts to the epoch of reionization. 
Unhindered by dust, atmospheric absorption, and sunlight, radio interferometric astronomical observations can be performed throughout the day from radio-quiet locations on earth. The deluge of data from various modern radio telescopes, although a challenge, posits tremendous potential for discovery. However, With growing concerns about increasing terrestrial radio interferences from satellite constellations, we are at a seminal moment in time. Several radio interferometers have come up or have undergone upgrades in recent years such as the JVLA, WSRT-Apertif, ASKAP, ALMA, LOFAR, MWA, MeerKAT, etc. These allow us to simultaneously survey vast regions on sky spanning a broad bandwidth and a range of sensitivities. This is just a start. With upcoming massive projects like the SKA, ngVLA, DSA, etc, our radio eyes will be sharper than ever before (although with bigger blind spots due to RFI). The future for the field looks exciting if we were to overlook the grim cloud that is looming over our heads.

## Small-scale distribution of metals and gas

Studying the small-scale properties of gas in these environments will offer clues to various open quandaries in galaxy evolution: On what scales are metals mixed? Do low and high ions have different coherence scales? How does it vary with the environment? 

One powerful observational technique employed to study gas is QSO absorption line spectroscopy which uses background [Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar) as flashlights to look through dark foreground gas reservoirs. On the way to our telescopes, the light from the background source picks up ‘absorption signatures’ left by metals (elements) in the intervening gas. Thus “illuminating” the intervening non-luminous gas along the pencil beam. By analysing the spectral imprints of the ions residing in the foreground gas reservoirs (ISM, CGM, IGrM, ICM, IGM) on the spectra of targeted background QSOs, we can study the physical and chemical properties of the foreground medium. Below, I discuss 3 past works in collaboration with Anand Narayanan, Jane Charlton, Bart Wakker, Blair Savage, et al.

>Studying gas reservoirs using information conveyed by tiny ions through passerby messengers that were sent out across spacetime by distant luminous sources.

Recently in [Sameer et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5796S/abstract) (fifth author), we study the physical and chemical properties of the Leo HI Ring and the Leo I Group using HST COS observations of 11 quasar sightlines spread over a ~ 600 x 800 kpc^2 region. We couple cloud-by-cloud, multiphase, Bayesian ionization modelling with galaxy property information to determine the plausible origin of the absorbing gas along these sightlines.

In my first, first-author paper ([Sankar et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.498.4864S/abstract), we utilize a series of diagnostic ions spanning a wide range of ionization energies (OIII to OVI) to study a sample of five intermediate redshift absorbers likely tracing the CGM. We perform detailed component-by-component modelling of high-resolution UV-HST and Optical-Keck archival spectroscopic data to extract information on the small-scale metallicity-density-temperature structure of the CGM. We also recover nucleosynthetic yields that predict a preferential enrichment from Type II SNe. We further report the lowest redshift intervening absorber with HeI detected, three systems with OV detected, and one system with NeV, NeVI detected along with O III to OVI. 

In [Pradeep, Sankar, et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.493..250P/abstract) we report a low redshift, multiphase weak-MgII analogue absorber that resides in an overdense environment with an ionization structure that is remarkably similar to that of Galactic high-velocity clouds. This work demonstrates the advantage of using weak low ionization absorbers as a means to study the CGM of external galaxies. 

The picture of the CGM emerging through several absorption line studies and hydrodynamic simulations is that of a multiphase medium that is composed of Hydrogen and Metals at various ionizations tracing gas in different temperature and density regimes. With the metals, especially the lower ionizations arising from patches in pc to even a few kpc confined in a diffuse hot corona. Our findings are consistent with a patchy metal distribution in the overall CGM environment.

#### Recent developments in QSO absorption line

QSO absorption line technique only allows us to probe a small area of the foreground structure, which limits our understanding of small-scale variations in properties. Although, when combined with statistics, this can offer a wealth of information on the large-scale distribution of gas. Several recent works have explored multiple sightlines through the same medium to understand small-scale property variations. However, due to the small number of sightlines piercing through any particular structure, the gas remains poorly sampled. Thanks to [Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_field_spectrograph), we can now utilize extended structures such as [gravitationally lensed](https://www.science.org.au/curious/space-time/gravitational-lensing) sources, galaxies, etc. as background sources. IFS provides a spectrum for each pixel in our 2D view of a source thus giving us a spatially resolved 3D representation of the target. This is a major update to the 50-year-old technique for studying gas, QSO absorption line spectroscopy.
